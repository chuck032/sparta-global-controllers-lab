For this project I was required to make 4 different controllers each containing 4 different methods. Using the command
\'*rails generate controller* *\"name of controller\" \"name of method\" etc.\'*
and using my understanding of rails routes.

These are the following controllers I created, along with the methods they have:

* Index Controller
  * First controller
  * Second controller
  * Third controller
  * Fourth controller

  * Postcode

  * Name on the Cardholder
