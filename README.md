# Sparta Global Controllers Lab

For this project we were required to make 4 different controllers each containing 4 different methods. Using the command
**'rails generate controller ** *"name of controller" "name of method" etc.'*
and using my understanding of rails routes.

These are the following controllers I created, along with the methods they have:

* Index Controller
  * First controller
  * Second controller
  * Third controller
  * Fourth controller


* User Controller
  * First Name
  * Last Name
  * Gender
  * Email


* Address Controller
  * House Number
  * Road/Street
  * City
  * Postcode


* Bank Controller
  * Name on the Cardholder
  * Card Number
  * Sort Code
  * Expiry Date
